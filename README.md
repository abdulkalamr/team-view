This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). The project has a home page where a tree-like chart of the employees in an organization is shown. Changes can be made to the chart by dragging and dropping employee nodes, except the root node, around the chart. The page also lists all the employees with the ability to filter the list based on teams and based on search queries.
